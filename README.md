# ASU-MATH-REU-Interpolation-Code

The ASU (AM)^2 REU is a research program for undergraduates to focus on applied math topics. I engaged in research in both the summers of 2019 and 2021. Although there is overlap, in the first summer I mainly focused on finding optimal parameters for KTE points (a mix between equally spaced points and Chebychev points), and in the second summer I focused on finding optimal interpolation nodes on 2D domains.

The user-friendly programs for each are __AnalysisKTE.m__ and __UltimateRBF.m__.
